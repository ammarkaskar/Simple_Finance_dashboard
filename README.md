# 💰 Finance Dashboard (Learning Project in Flutter on DartPad)

This is a **learning project** I built while practicing Flutter on [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/).  
It is not a full-fledged production application — the goal was to explore **UI building, layout structuring, and data presentation**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
- To **practice Flutter basics** such as widgets, layouts, and styling.  
- To get hands-on experience with **dashboard-style UI**.  
- To create a small but complete project for my **portfolio as a student**.  

---

## 🚀 Features (for practice)
- 📊 **Expense Overview** → Simple expense cards with amounts.  
- 💵 **Monthly Savings** → List of savings per month.  
- 🎨 **Clean UI** → Practiced building layouts with Material Design.  
- ⚡ **Runs on DartPad** → No setup required.
